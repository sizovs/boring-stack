# What is this?

This is my starter for full-stack web app development on Node.

Since JS and TS ecosystem suffers from extreme churn, forcing 'a big rewrite' on app developers every 3-5 years, it's better and safer to build on top of stable and boring foundation.

I don't think it's reasonable to split apps prematurely across all axes â€” 1) vertically (microservices), 2) horizontally (BE / FE), and 3) across servers (e.g. DB running on a separate machine) and instread prefer building self-contained, monolith systems that run on a single server. Such systems can handle 10,000s of requests on a beefy VPS (which is enough for most apps) and can be split into multiple self-contained systems for scalability, if necessary.

Such simple architectures also diminish the benefit of running on PaaS or cloud hyperscalers that are opaque and expensive abstractions over servers. Thus, I am running my stuff on Hetzner (or any other VPC), provisioning servers with Terraform, and deploying using a simple, homegrown bash script that supports zero downtime deployments.


As a guiding principes, I bet on stability, simplicity, and fewer abstractions. As a result, I made the following tech choices:
* javascript
* express
* sqlite
* livestream for DB replication to R2
* better-sqlite3 for DB access
* htmx for SPA experience
* edge.js for templating
* alpine.js for sprinkling JS here and there
* css for styling w/o build tools

By looking into the code you'll discover some lesser-known gems such as Japa testing library or Vine validation library.

# Provisioning infra
```
task terraform -- init
task terraform -- apply
```

# Deploying to production

You'll need to create `<project_dir>/.env` file with the following content and fill missing production values before deploying:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DB_LOCATION=/mnt/database/db.sqlite3
COOKIE_SECRET=<secret goes here>
```

```
task deploy
```

# Running an app locally
```
npm install
task migrate
task dev
```

# Troubleshooting on prod
```
npm run repl
```
