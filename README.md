# What is this?

This is a started for full-stack web applications running on Node.

Since JS and TS framework ecosystem suffers from extreme churn, forcing 'a big rewrite' on app developers every 3-5 years, it's better and safer to build on top of stable and boring foundation.

We don't think it's reasonable to split apps prematurely across all axes â€” 1) vertically (microservices), 2) horizontally (BE / FE), and 3) across servers (e.g. DB running on a separate machine) and instread prefer building on self-contained "monolith" systems that run on a single server. Such systems can handle 10,000s of requests on a beafy VPS (which is enough for most apps) and can be split into multiple self-contained systems for scalability, if necessary.

Such simple architectures also diminishes the benefit of running on PaaS or cloud hyperscalers that are opaque and expensive abstractions over the server. Thus, we're running our stuff on Hetzner (or other VPC), provision it with Terraform, and deploy using simple bash script.


As a guiding principes, we bet on stability, simplicity, and fewer abstractions. As a result, we made the following tech choices:
* javascript
* express
* sqlite
* livestream for DB replication to R2
* better-sqlite3 for DB access
* htmx for SPA experience
* edge.js for templating
* alpine.js for sprinkling JS here and there
* css w/o build tools

# Provisioning infra
```
  task terraform -- init
  task terraform -- apply
```

# Running a demo app
```
npm install
task migrate
task dev
```

# Troubleshooting on prod
```
npm run repl
```
